<img src="kitana.jpg" height=301 width=178 align=LEFT>Kitana was made from
a mix of parts from the MK Jade figure and AoA Jean Grey figure. I went
as far as to cut the arms, legs, and torsos into segments and put them
together for the desired effect. The MK Jade would have been an easy repaint
if I had chosen that route, but it was the old "standing at attention"
pose that I disdain.<br>
