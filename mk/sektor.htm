<img src="sektor.jpg" height=328 width=186 align=LEFT>Sektor is the first
of the Mortal Kombat customs that I have done. He is a repainted Steel
(the movie) action figure - I don't remember which particular one. The
only real additions I made were the wires coming out of the back of the
head and the loincloth made from Friendly Plastic. I was surprised how
well this basic repaint captured the likeness of the character.<br>
