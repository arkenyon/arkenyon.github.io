<img src="scorpion.jpg" height=320 width=199 align=LEFT>Scorpion was a
long time in the making. He was really my first foray into customizing
since I was a kid. He is made from a Mission Impossible Tom Cruise figure
(the one with the blue shirt). After a fair amount of sanding, I used epoxy
putty to sculpt the mask, armbands, and shin guards. The tunic and loincloth
are one piece; cut from a plastic milk jug and then heated into shape.
I tried Friendly Plastic for this, but it kept breaking when I bent it
into such a sharp curve. The open hand is from a Water Wars Wolverine.<br>

<img src="scorp_h.jpg" height=100 width=101 align=RIGHT>I don't think I
would recommend this recipe - there are probably better base figures. The
only real advantage to the MI base is that it is fairly plain, allowing
more freedom of appearance in the finished product.</h4>
