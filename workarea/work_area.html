      <p>My wife and I decided to give our bedroom a "makeover" which meant that all my cutomizing junk had to find a new home.  We have a small walk-in closet, my side of which had piles of comics, figures and accessories.  Also, I have a small desk and cabinet I have been using for storing customizing stuff.  Well, I cleaned out the closet and built some shelves and put the desk in the closet, making myself a cozy organized customizing work area.  Thought you might like to see it, and maybe get some ideas.</p>

      <p>The desk has a drawer, a closable, "secretary" type desk and shelves with cabinet doors on top.  I keep paints in the front, some work-in-progress figs on the bottom shelf and my customs in the cabinets.  On the bookshelves on the right, I keep all my TBPs and comics.  On the bookshelves on the left, I keep my comic references and various customizing supplies.  On the shelves above the desk, I keep my figure fodder.</p>

      <p>Although it may seem a little much, I try to keep my paints organized as well.  It helps me sort through the colors when I am trying to find a match for a particular character's costume, and also helps me avoid buying colors I already have.  These are all cheap craft acrylics.  You are looking at the bottom of the bottle.</p>
