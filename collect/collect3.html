      <p><center><h3>The Undeniable Evidence</H3></center>Below is my collection of action figures.  A few on display, many carded and loose in boxes, and bushels of loose fodder.  Even my customs are in a box!  You can see them in a small box in the top right corner of the "Fodder & Customs" picture.  Compare the bulk volume of completed customs to the amount of fodder to get an idea of the problem.  I've seen pictures like this of peoples houses who have a packrat-type mental disorder where they keep piles of stuff they don't need.  Scary, isn't it?</p>

      <p><center><h3>Recovery?</H3></center>I'm in the process of filtering out my collection for the severalth time, hoping to decrease my inventory by at least a third.  I've settled into a finite number of groups of figures, although each group could potentially be very large.  They are, in no particular order:  6" comic characters (DC, Marvel, Spawn, other), 8" movie figures (Universal Monsters, Movie Maniacs, others), dragons, and a few specialty pieces.  That's still a lot, but it is progress.  I mean, I could be collecting animated, Famous Covers, Megos, Super Powers, GI Joes, 5", Transformers, Dragonball, and many more.  I am also making great strides in organizing and cleaning up the figures I am keeping.  In addition, I'm finally taking most of those expensive DC Direct  figures off of their cards.</p>

      <p><center><h3>Conclusion</H3></center>Now you be the judge - avid enthusiast or geek with obsessive/compulsive disorder?  Only time will tell.   If nothing else, it keeps me occupied and busy, and gives me something to strive for.  In a few years I may even get out of the hobby altogether.  Who knows how many figures are they going to release over the next five years?  Ten years?  I would have no place to put them all.  Maybe I could bury them in mason jars in the backyard...</P>
