      <p><center><h3>Hypothesis</H3></center>I've spent some time thinking about this crazy action figure collecting hobby, trying to devine the drive behind it.  Some action figure collectors are huge comic fans, others are sci-fi fanboys, others are toy fanatics, and yes, some are actually kids.  Personally, I don't fit particularly well into any of these categories, although I can see a bit of each in me.  Maybe its a combination of all of the above coupled with my longtime love of art and sculpture.  I used to draw (pretty good, in fact) frequently, but the business of life and the pressure of fitting in with my peers squelched most of that hobby.  I haven't drawn much of anything in 15 years or more.  Maybe I'll post some of my old drawings sometime.</p>

      <p><center><h3>The Beginning</H3></center>Back to my point:  About 5 years ago I saw a Horizon model kit of Carnage, and I was blown away.  It was an incredible representation of the character, much better than any of the action figures (Mego, etc.) than I had played with as a kid.  But then again, I'm not a kid any more.  I don't play with toys...right?  I just thought it would look great sitting on a shelf in my room.  I started doing a little investigation and found out that assembling and painting figure kits was a whole hobby unto itself.  By way of the wonderful new Internet, <a href="http://www.gremlins.com">Gremlins in the Garage</a> introduced me to an underground society that encompassed many genres.  And then I saw the price tags.  $50? $100??  More???  Jeesh, I was going to have to take on a second job to get into this hobby!</p>

      <p><center><h3>Point of No Return</H3></center>Then my girlfriend at the time (now my wife), made the fatal mistake of buying me an action figure.  It was a Sauron from one of the earlier Toy Biz lines.  Not as good a sculpt as the Horizon kits, but 1/10th the price.  I had been casually eyeing action figures over the years, just checking to see what was out there.  I had not yet had the nerve to actually pick one up and buy it though.  When my wife bought that Sauron however, the little Dutch boy pulled his finger out of the dike, so to speak.  I had "permission" to actually peruse the action figure aisles and even buy one or two here and there.</p>
