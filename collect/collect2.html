      <p><center><h3>Addiction</H3></center>The more I looked, the more I noticed the increasing quality of sculpts in action figures.  Posability was reduced or made awkward, but that didn't matter to much to me.  I was just going to display them anyway.  At first I stuck to monsters, still a little wary of the stigma associated with comics by the (largely uninformed) public at large.  Gradually though, I couldn't resist assembling an X-Men roster, and things grew from there.  Pretty soon I was collecting figures from numerous lines, with no real focus other than I thought they were cool.  A couple of times I nearly fell into the completist black hole, but managed to be at least somewhat selective.</p>

      <p><center><h3>The Gateway</H3></center>Doctors use the term "gateway drugs" to refer to moderate drugs such as alchohol and cigarettes, that  can lead to the use of much harder drugs.  Collecting action figures can have the same effect.  Although toy companies are releasing hundreds of figures, they still may not be of the quality, style, or character that you want.  Enter <b>customizing</b>.  Now you have an excuse to buy a bunch of figures that you don't even want, because you plan to make something new out of them.  This has been my greatest weakness.  I've stockpiled tons of figures because I <i>may</i> have a use for them <i>sometime</i>.  Granted, on occasion I've been glad to have a few obscure figures that allowed me to create an original custom, but I cannot begin to justify the mountains of fodder I have accumulated.</p>

      <p><center><h3>My name is Ron, and I'm a figure-holic</H3></center>I'll let the evidence speak for itself.  On the next page are pictures of my action figure collection - an impressive display of cardboard boxes stacked up in my closet and garage.  Other than the occasional figure lying around, I only have two small displays in my house.  The rest are boxed up.  If I'm not going to display them, why do I keep buying them?  I don't know.  I think I'm afraid that I'm going to miss out on something that will be very hard to get later on.  I also hope to have a nice large display someday, but unfortunately, action figures don't fit in with most interior design schemes.</p>
