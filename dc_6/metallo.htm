<img src="metal_f.jpg" height=367 width=546 align=LEFT>Metallo is my first
foray into the 6" scale for DC figures. I had been wanting to make a Metallo
custom for a long time, but could never come up with a base that I was
happy with. I saw a small cameo picture of him in the Underworld Unleashed
story, and thought, "where have I seen that face before?" Then it struck
me - the Missle Flyers Apocolypse. I had bought this figure on sale a long
time ago and thrown it in a box because it was so weird-looking.<br>

<img src="metal_c.jpg" height=267 width=347 align=RIGHT>The custom is basically
a repaint. I sanded down and filled a hole that was in the chest cavity.
I also sculpted the "skull" nose. The paint job was done entirely (except
the eyes and teeth) by drybrushing. I first painted the figure flat black,
then drybrushed metallic silver on top. I finished with gloss acrylic clear
coat to enhance the armored effect.<br>
<br>
This custom took only a few hours total to create (my shortest ever!),
yet I am very happy with it. There is a photo below with the DC Heroes
Supes to get an idea of the scale.<br>
