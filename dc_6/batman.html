      <td valign="_top">Batman was made from a LOTDK Dark Knight Batman.  I added 8 new points of articulation, for a total of 13.  The ankle and knee joints came from X-Man, and the elbow and forearm joints came from a Skeleton Warriors figure.  I also trimmed the cape, ears, and arm spines.  The figure has a gray drybrush on the body and dark blue on the cape, cowl, boots, and gloves (doesn't show well in pictures).  The intention was to create a Batman figure that closely resembles the Morrison JLA version.<br><br>

        This custom was inspired directly by <a href="http://www.execpc.com/~radtke/cusindex/kjbm.html">Valors' excellent version</a>.  The new articulation was inspired by <a href="http://www.ne.jp/asahi/nate/slinger/top2.html">Spinner's incredible multiposable custom figures</a>.  Unfortunately, the added articulation turned out to be mostly an academic excercise.  The cape restricts the figure's movement, and the lack of ball-jointed hips and shoulders doesn't help.<br><br>

        I wrote a <a href="../artic/artic1.html">how-to article</a> that explains the joint-addition process.
