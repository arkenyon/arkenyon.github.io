          <p>I decided to do this custom on a whim.  I was flipping through the Who's Who, and saw this character.  It brought back a long-since buried memory of the Superman comic I had as a kid with the Galactic Golem storyline. The Golem was a Lex Luthor creation, made out of galactic matter that he was able to bring to life.<br><br> </p>  

          <p>Galactic Golem was made from a LTR Newborn Lurtz figure, with a haircut, manicure, and pedicure.  It was painted entirely with flourescent (neon) paints for that soothing meteoric glow.  I took some photos in regular and black light:</p>
