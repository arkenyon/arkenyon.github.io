      <td valign="_top">Bane was made from a LOTDK Bane.  I cut off the hair, tubing, and those long, gnarly fingernails.  I cut about 1/4" to 1/2" out of the lower legs to get the figure down to a more reasonable height.  The Venom injector was made from some leftover cell phone accessory.<br><br>

        I used images from the Knightfall storyline as references.  There is a drybrush of dark blue on the costume which is not very visible in these photos.  I started this custom well over a year ago, but got distracted.<br><br>
