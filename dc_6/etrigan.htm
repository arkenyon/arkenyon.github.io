<h4>
<img src="etrig_f.jpg" height=460 width=403 align=LEFT>This is my second
customizing attempt at Etrigan. The first was in the TJ/JLA scale, and
can be seen here: <a href="../dc/etrigan.htm">TJ Etrigan</a>. This custom
is an amalgam of the various artists' interpretations of the character.
The biggest influence was the BTAS version. This is obviously not an animated-style
custom, but I like the sheer bulk the character had in the cartoon. You
can get an idea of the scale by comparison with the DC Heroes Batman shown
below.<br>
<br>
The parts I used are as follows:

<li>Abomination head and cape</li>

<li>Paul White Maximum Sweat body</li>

<li>Onslaught Wolverine hands</li>

<li>plastic bat wings for ears</li>

<li>Electro-spark Spiderman spikes for horns</li>

<br>I used Magic Sculp for the boot cuffs, shirt sleeve ends, and back
of the hands. The spiked bracelets are rubber bands with toothpick points
stuck through and glued on.

<p><img src="etrig_c.jpg" height=319 width=417 align=RIGHT>The shirt, boots
and cape were dry-brushed, while the yellow skin tones were washed to create
a shadowed effect. I would have dry-brushed the skin also, but the yellow-on-brown
scheme I was using didn't work too well. I had to mask off the different
colored sections while dry-brushing. It took me nearly two months to muster
the willpower to finish painting this thing...Ugh.</h4>
