<img src="fate_rs.jpg" height=549 width=376 align=LEFT>Dr. Fate was made
from a Zorro figure. I had to lengthen the legs and torso by about 1/4"
each to make the figure tall enough to fit in with the other 6" DC figures.
The right arm was switched with the Zorro throwing knife figure (cut right
above the elbow). The helmet and girdle (for lack of a better word) were
sculpted from epoxy clay. The amulet is simply two buttons glued together.
I gloss-coated the helmet and amulet to make them look more metallic.<br>
