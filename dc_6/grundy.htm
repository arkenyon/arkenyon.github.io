<h4>
<img src="grundy.jpg" height=517 width=409 align=LEFT>Solomon Grundy started out as a simple repaint of a Grey Hulk figure.  As I got into it though, a fair amount more work was required.  First I had to make him an inch taller to meet the requisite 7' 2" character height.  I did this by adding a half an inch to both calves and thighs, and filling with Magic Sculp.  I trimmed the jacket down, removed the tie, and sculpted some sleeves and hair onto the figure.<br>

<img src="grundy_c.jpg" height=240 width=240 align=RIGHT>The paint job is my now standard drybrush.  It required some careful masking to keep the crisp edges.  For the zombie-like skintone, I started with a charcoal grey base and drybrushed with dolphin gray.<br>
