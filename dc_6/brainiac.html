      <td valign="_top">Brainiac was made from a Spawn Interlink LA-6 figure.  This custom is mostly a repaint.  I removed all of the accessories and spray-painted him silver.  I then did a careful black wash to bring out the details in the sculpt, of which there are many.  I was going for a cold, clinical look, similar to the Crisis on Infinite Earths version.  The close-up below shows the fine detail in the figure.<br><br>

        The figure had a gun for a right hand, which I thought was out-of-character.  I cut the gun down and made it into an evil probe.  The figure also had some sort of spidery accessories which I reworked in to a mechanical claw accessory.  Without the claw, the figure has 15 points of articulation.  With the claw it has 24!  I also re-routed his wiring to add some color and variety to the custom.<br><br>
