      <td valign="_top">Superman was made from a DC Heroes Superman figure.  The Hasbro version was pigeon-toed, had scoliosis, was wall-eyed, and worst of all, had underdeveloped calves!  Some Superman!  I rotated the thighs, built up the calves, straightened the torso, and trimmed down the lantern jaw.  A darker paint job, and now we have the true man of steel.<br><br>

        Take a look at the pictures below to get an idea of the extent of the changes.  Fortuitously, the torso straightening added about 1/4" in height.  I used decal paper (commonly used for model car kits) to get the basic Superman emblem.  I considered a head swap until I saw <a href="http://www.ironcowprod.com/Plastic/Angst/super7in.html">Iron Cow's</a> work so well.<br><br>
