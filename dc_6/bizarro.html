      <td valign="_top">Bizarro was made from a DC Heroes Superman lower torso, Sandman upper torso & head, and Darkstalkers Dimitori hands.  I sanded the figure and sculpted on some hair.  I chose the darker paint scheme to stand out from Superman.<br><br>

        This figure started as an old-school Bizarro; you know, the blocky-looking one.  I was just sculpting onto the already deformed DC Heroes Superman figure (see <a href="superman.html">Superman custom</a> for explanation).  Unfortunately, it was looking like crap.  I found a new head and torso, and it came out much better, IMO.<br><br>
