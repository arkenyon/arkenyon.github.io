              <p>I made this custom because I did not like the build on the retail black costume Spiderman.  This base figure is Parachute(?) Spiderman I believe - great posability.  There is a dark blue drybrush to mimic the look of the comic, but it is not very apparent in this photo.  Painting the spider emblem was a real pain in the arse.</p>

              <p>To avoid paint scrapage, I employed a combination of two techniques.  First I colored all of the joints with a black Sharpie marker.  I moved each one to see any scrape points, shaved those down, and colored again until I had no scrapage.  Then I spray painted the figure black with Krylon Vinyl Color.  Finally, I drybrushed the blue and sealed with matte acrylic sealer.  The figure has had <em>no</em> paint scrapage, a first for me!  This is quite remarkable considering the posability of the figure (see below).  Others should try this technique and see if they get the same performance.</p>
