          <p>Viper, aka Madam Hydra, was made from a Danger Girls Natalia Kassel head and arms, Sidney Savage upper torso, and Matrix Trinity lower torso and legs.  A simple Natalia Kassel repaint would have probably worked just as well, but I had already Frankensteined the Danger Girl parts for an abandoned Charlie's Angels project.  The hard part was matching the skin tones on the torso.  Also, the Natalia figure is a little too tall for 6" scale.</p>

          <p>I sculpted some extra hair to hide part of her face, in trademark Viper fashion.  I also used translucent green paint to change her eye color.  The whip and pistol were random fodder box accessories.  I made a couple of <a href="hydra.html">Hydra goons</a> for company.  Group shot below:</p>
