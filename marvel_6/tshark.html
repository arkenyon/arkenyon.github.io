          <p><img src="tshark_h.jpg" width="89" height="122" align="right">Tigershark was made from a Golberg body and a Despero head.  The Goldberg head probably would have worked, but the Despero head was perfect, especially with the jagged teeth.  Besides, <i>somebody</i> needed to use this figure for <i>something</i>. <br><br> <center></center></p>

          <p><img src="tshark_side.jpg" width="71" height="84" align="left">The large dorsal fin and smaller lateral fins were made from vinyl (thanks for the idea <a href="http://www.ironcowprod.com">Iron Cow dudes</a>!)  I cut slots in the figure to secure the fins.</p>

          <br clear="all"><br>
          <p>The jagged lines were a pain to paint, especially while trying to accomodate drybrushing.  The Tigershark costume has always been one of my favorites in the Marvel Universe.  I thought this guy was tough until I discovered that his costume colors were apricot and periwinkle!</p>
