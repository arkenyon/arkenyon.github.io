          <p>This is just a couple of Hydra henchmen that I made to go along with my <a href="viper.html">Viper</a> custom.  They were made from Daredevil movie figures.  The H logo was made from toothpaste tube and the sub-machine guns and pistols were just random leftover accessories.</p>  

          <p>I thought for a bit that it might be cool to make a small army of these relatively easy customs, but then sanity prevailed.  I mean, a Hydra lackey is already pretty lame.  Why should I make more of them?</p>
