          <p><a href="mag5.jpg" target="_new"><img src="magneto_s.jpg" width="131" height="142" align="right"></a>Magneto was made from a Fists of the North Star figure, with some sculpted on accessories.  The helmet was from a reworked (name escapes me) Foot Soldier, and the cape is a repainted from a WildCATS Hellspont figure.</p>

          <p><a href="magneto_col1.jpg" target=_new"><img src="magneto_s1.jpg" width="138" height="278" align="left"></a>When I first saw this figure, it immediately jumped out at me as Magneto.  I mostly just had to do some sanding and sculpting.  The neckpiece is Magic Sculp with small nail heads for the disks.  The belt is a rubber band and the armband and bootbands are made from toothpaste tube.  The cape was painted with Plastic Paint.</p>

          <p>The figure has a limited amount of usable articulation, but the shoulders, elbows, and wrists allow for some dramatic poses, as you can see below.  I am quite pleased with this custom, and very thankful to finally have it finished.</p>
