          <p>He hails from...beyond.  He "beyonds" more than any other.  He is The Beyonder!</p>  

          <p>Relatively simple recipe: 2000 AD Johnny Alpha head, McFarlane Akira body, DCD Hourman arms.  I was inspired by this head, which to me looks just like the Beyonder.  I cut some of the straps off of the costume, for fear of a resemblance to Michael Jackson.  I tried to match the "Malibu tan" of the face on the arms.  Probably one of the very few customs I will make that looks something like a regular person.</p>

          <p>Hopefully I will have a better quality pic available soon.</p>
