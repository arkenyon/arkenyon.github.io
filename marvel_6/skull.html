      <td valign="_top">The Red Skull was made from a Buffy Master figure with a Headless Horseman skull head.  I sculpted eyeballs and trimmed the pointy teeth on the face.  I also sculpted on jack boots and added wrist articulation.<br><br>

        I carved a cosmic cube out of casting plastic and used an LED from another figure to light it up.  I had to make a forearm-mounted assebly to hold the wiring and batteries.  I tried to make it look like some kind of power harness for the cube.<br><br>

        This figure has weird leg articulation, but it does allow him to sit down for an interview with Space Ghost.<br><br>
