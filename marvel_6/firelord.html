          <p>One of my favorite characters from days gone by, just because I thought he was cool-looking.  I started to go with some new-fangled metallic version (a la Silver Surfer and Nova) but instead went for the old school look, as accurate as I could muster.  The base is Mattel Superman (from the Batman/Superman 2-pack) with donated hands and head (don't know the name of either).  The flames are from the ToyBiz X-Man figure.  I was able to rub the red paint off with fingernail polish remover, to let the yellow base show through.  Paint scrapage was a major headache on this one, even with lots of cutting and sanding, so I don't pose him too much.</p>
