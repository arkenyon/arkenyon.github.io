Here are some photos from my recent family trip to Orlando.  Most of these are from the Universal  <br> Islands of Adventure park which has a large section with a Marvel comics theme.

  Heroes on parade - on 4 wheelers.

  <img src="cap.jpg"><br>
  A very goofy-looking Captain America leading the pack.

  <br><br><br>
  <img src="storm.jpg"><br>
  Storm.  I believe RuPaul was filling in this particular day.

  <br><br><br>
  <img src="doom_goblin.jpg"><br>
  Dr. Doom and the Green Goblin riding the dune-buggy of terror.

  <img src="doom.jpg"><br>
  Close-up of Dr. Doom.  Is he smiling?!

  <img src="spidey.jpg"><br>
  The wife and I meet Spiderman, at her insistence no less.<br>
  I tried to get my picture with Rogue and Storm, but the<br>
  fanboy line was too long and scary.

  <br><br><br>
  <img src="cape.jpg"><br>
  Christopher Reeves' cape from Superman 1.<br>
  I believe this was from MGM Studios.
