<h4>
<img src="croc.jpg" height=284 width=162 align=LEFT>Killer Croc was made
from an X-Men 2099 Bloodhawk figure. After removing the wings and fins
under the arms, all I had to do was fill in the back with putty and then
paint.<br>
<br>
I wish that I had thought of this recipe myself, but I got the idea from
a figure that was for sale on E-Bay.<br>
