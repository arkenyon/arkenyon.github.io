<h4>
<img src="heatwave.jpg" height=251 width=248 align=LEFT>Heatwave is made
from a Starship Troopers figure and a TJ Flash head. The mask is made from
small pieces of vinyl (from a shower curtain) cut with an exacto knife.
The rest is just repaint. I matte coated the figure and gloss coated the
gun.<br>
<br>
When I first saw this Starship Troopers figure, it just screamed Heatwave.
It is scaled and styled nicely to fit in with Total Justice figs. I know
Heatwave usually used a pistol, but I thought the big flamethrower looked
good too. Hey, we're entitled to a little artistic license!<br>
