Mirror Master</h2></center>

<h4>
<img src="mirror.jpg" height=262 width=169 align=LEFT>The Mirror Master
was made from a TJ Black Lightning body and Spiderman AS Scorpion head.
The collar was made from epoxy putty and the weird ear cover on the mask
was made from a piece of rubber band (thanks CC list dudes!).<br>
<br>
I also repositioned the arms and hands to make it look a little different
from BL. Removing the engraved lightning bolts was the biggest challenge
on this custom.<br>
