<img src="zoom.jpg" height=257 width=182 align=LEFT>The Reverse Flash is
basically a Daredevil repaint, with ear-wing thingies from a TJ Flash.
I had thought about using this base for a while but I wasn't sure if it
would work. The <a href="http://www.realtime.net/~jdh2/leslie/wallywest.html" target="_top">Hancock's
Flash</a> removed all doubt. Also, <a href="http://www.realtime.net/~jdh2/leslie/article-decoupage.html" target="_top">Leslie
Hancock's decoupage article</a> was very helpful in making and applying
the chest emblem.<br>
<br>
The figure is a little tall to be compatible with Total Justice figures,
but with the ball-jointed legs I can "superpose" him to make him fit in.<br>
