<h4>
<img src="etrigan.jpg" height=244 width=203 align=LEFT>Etrigan was the
first custom figure that I finished. He was constructed from a ToyBiz Water
Wars Wolverine body and a Hercules (TV series) Mesomorph head and arms.
The really cool thing about this custom is that both base figures had the
rotating forearms feature, and I was able to incorporate this articulation
into Etrigan. He is intended to fit in with my Total Justice figures.<br>
