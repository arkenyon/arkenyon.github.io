<blockquote>
Here is a quick preview of my foray into 4" scale figures.  Thus far (as of June 2006), I have only completed 2 figures - Etrigan and Brainiac.  I am primarily using the DC Direct 4" pvc, Japanese Gashapon, and other similar figures as bases.  So far, I'm pretty psyched about the possibilities.
