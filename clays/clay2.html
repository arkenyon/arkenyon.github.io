        <br><br>
        "Hard to find for some, but worth ordering.  Dries very strong but can still be cut and sanded for sharp edges."<br><br>
        "The best I have worked with, but could have a slightly longer working time."<br><br>
        "Use water, and blend really well.  A great product but the mixing and mess is a pain."<br><br>
        "It could be that I got the cheap grade, or a bad batch, but I really didn't like this stuff, couldn't work with it at all, only slightly better than Das Pronto."<br><br>  
        "This is still my favorite stuff, the only thing I wish it had was longer time to sculpt, but for me that is not really an issue, its sandability (super fine white grade) more than makes up for it. I do a lot of 'dry' sculpting that way with it."<br><br> 
        "Water needed for avoiding stickiness. If sticky during blending stage, wet hands."<br><br>
        "Very nice for its smoothability and hardness but stickiness is a slight problem. Water will help with stickiness, but makes a mess."<br><br>

        <br><br>
        "I've only used MS's free sample from a few years back, so make of this what you will, but I found it much harder to mix the parts equally than Milliput, and mismixed MS just doesn't quite dry.  It also dried out after a fairly short time."<br><br>
        "A little too sticky for my liking, but great in the absence of Milliput."<br><br> 
        "Must mix thoroughly. Reasonably long working time. Water helps overcome stickiness, but reduces sculptability."<br><br> 
        "This is my clay of choice, easiest self hardening epoxy to work with."<br><br>
        "I used to use this about as much as Milliput until about 2 years ago. They must have changed it or something because the batch I had was just terrible, it wouldn't set and was sticking to everything. I may go and try it again someday but that last experience with it was not a good one."<br><br>

        "Cheap clay that's good for filling in big gaps in a figure's surface after dremelling. I'd never use it for detail work but it's great for filling holes."<br><br>
        "Inexpensive and readily available at retail stores. Very short working time. Good for filling large areas and creating structural components.  Many brands available."<br><br> 
        "Use only for large, roughed in areas. Not for detail work."<br><br> 
        "An affordable and effective means to perform heavy-duty structural work. Perfect for filling swiss-cheese holes and substantial cavities in figures. Difficult to refine before curing, but sands like a dream once it's hardened completely. Follow up with a more responsive product for details."<br><br>

        "Doesn't like to adhere to figures and needs to be glued to strengthen to bond.Crumbles when sanded after boiling.Good for large add on parts."<br><br>
        "Must be baked, which can be problematic for action figure customizing. Boiling or heat gun are baking alternatives. Easier to sculpt with when mixed with 2 oz. packages of Sculpey III black and white. Can be baked multiple times for adding/freezing detail. Generally preferred clay for standalone sculpture."<br><br> 
        "You have to really bake it by the directions and you may melt your figure at the higher temperature. Good for big original sculpts."<br><br> 
        "The fragility is enough to turn me off this stuff."<br><br>
        "A smooth, workable polymer clay, excellent for retaining fine details, but dries to a brittle finish. Surface tends to crack under pressure, as with etching lines after curing. Bake at 220 degrees for ten minutes. Sands to a glossy sheen, if somewhat translucent."<br><br> 
        "The best clay to work with, but must be baked and is still fragile after baking."<br><br>
        "Goor for original parts that need to be added, but not for detailing as it need to be boiled (uhg) or bakes (melts figure)."<br><br>
