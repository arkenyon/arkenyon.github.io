<img src="doc_sam.jpg" height=437 width=323 align=LEFT>This figure was made to replace the smaller animated-looking Doc Samson.  This one is much bigger and more detailed than the Toy Biz version.  I chose the outlandish costume because Doc irradiated himself with gamma radiation to become a superhero, so it just seemed appropriate.<br><br>

<img src="doc_h.jpg" height=100 width=100 align=RIGHT>Doc was made from a ES Captain America body, MA Wolverine head, and MF Bishop forearms and hands.  I added some Magic Sculp hair to the back of his head.  My kids asked me if I was going to paint his hair "puke green" like the comic, and I enthusiastically said yes!<br>

Here's a back shot of the figure:<img src="doc_b.jpg" height=257 width=185 align=RIGHT></h4>
