<h4>
<img src="vision.jpg" height=284 width=225 align=LEFT>The Vision was made
from a Silver Surfer figure. I was inspired by Chris Galdieri's larger
Silver Surfer based custom (<a href="http://www.mania.com//columns/scratch/scratch071098.html" target="_top">see
it here</a>). The cape is from one of the Warriors of Virtue figures, and
the collar was cut from a piece of toothpaste tube material.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
I like the newer SS figures because they are about 1/2" taller than the
earlier version, which makes them fit in better with 5 1/2" scale figures.
The only downside is that Toy Biz made the figure taller by adding a ball
joint lower torso, which I had to fill with epoxy putty.&nbsp;<img src="vision_h.jpg" height=100 width=100 align=RIGHT></h4>
