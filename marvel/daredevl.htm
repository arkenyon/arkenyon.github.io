<img src="daredevl.jpg" height=303 width=187 align=LEFT>You are probably
asking yourself, why would someone customize a Daredevil figure when ToyBiz
has released a perfectly good one? Well, "good" is a subjective term. I
never really liked the ToyBiz version because it was scrawny compared to
other figures, and it had an odd orange-red color. Plus, it was just too
darn brightly-colored to be Daredevil.<br>
<br>
<img src="dare_h.jpg" height=100 width=100 align=RIGHT>My custom is the
Daredevil <i>face</i> glued onto the Beetle head and body. I was going
to just do a head swap, but DD's head was too small. The chest emblem was
decoupaged on and painted. The billy club pieces are toothpicks inside
small rubber tubing to get the correct diameter. I painted heavy shadows
in an attempt to duplicate his appearance in the comics.<br>
<br>
I've included ToyBiz's version for comparison:&nbsp;<img src="dare_tb.jpg" height=275 width=178 align=RIGHT></h4>
