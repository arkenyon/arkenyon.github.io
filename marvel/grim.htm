<h4>
<img src="grim.jpg" height=490 width=413 align=LEFT>Considering his history in Marvel comics, the Grim Reaper deserved to be captured in plastic.  He was made from a Classic X-Men Cyclops head; Loki upper torso, arms, and feet; and Adam Warlock hips and legs.  The cape is a trimmed down Swarm Cape.  I may replace the cape with a better one.<br><br>

<img src="grim_h.jpg" height=100 width=100 align=RIGHT>The headgear and scythe blade were the most challenging parts.  The headgear was cut from a CD jewel box case and inserted into his head via a slot I cut with a Dremel.  The blade was also cut from a CD jewel box.  I attached it to his arm using miscellaneous parts, and kept the rotational articulation by sticking a thumbtack into the shaft.  This is hidden under the arm cap.<br>
<br>
Here's a side shot showing another blade position.<img src="grim_s.jpg" height=249 width=194 align=RIGHT></h4>
