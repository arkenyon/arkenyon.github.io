<img src="rad_man.jpg" height=325 width=207 align=LEFT>Radioactive Man
was made from a Goldberg head, torso, and upper legs. The arms and lower
legs are from Missle Flyers Bishop. The loincloth is a cut-up Doc Oc loincloth.
The tank-top and chest emblem are from a toothpaste tube.<br>
<br>
<img src="rad_h.jpg" height=100 width=100 align=RIGHT>The skin tone is
a mixture of neon yellow and neon green in an attempt to create a glowing
effect. Photos (scans) never seem to be able to recreate neon or flourescent
colors. I want to try taking a photo of the figure under a black light
to see if it really glows.<br>
<br>
Here is a picture of the character if you are not familiar with him. He
has been a member of the Masters of Evil among others, and is another Marvel
character reaping the benefits of the benevolent effects of massive doses
of gamma radiation.<br>

<img src="rad_com1.jpg" height=345 width=193 align=RIGHT> Now, before someone
tells me my custom doesn't have the boot cuffs, here is another picture
where the character doesn't either. I don't remember anyone wearing boot
cuffs in the seventies or eighties. I have no idea why they were so popular
in the comics.&nbsp;<img src="rad_com2.jpg" height=272 width=150 align=RIGHT></h4>
