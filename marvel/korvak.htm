<img src="korvak.jpg" height=443 width=215 align=LEFT>For those of you
unfamiliar with this character, Korvak was yet another nearly omnipotent
megalomaniacal Marvel bad guy. He was about 8' or 10' tall and was composed
of energy, hence the negative x-ray appearance.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<img src="korvak_h.jpg" height=100 width=100 align=RIGHT>To create Korvak,
I just repainted a 10" Captain Marvel figure. The real challenge was painting
shadowed areas in a light color and vice versa.<br>
<br>
Here's a pic in case you don't know who he is.&nbsp;<img src="korvac.gif" height=407 width=169 align=RIGHT></h4>
