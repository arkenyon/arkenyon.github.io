      <p>I spend a fair amount of time traveling, and I thought it would be nice to be able to do a little customizing while I am away.  I found a nearly perfect portable container for my supplies in Wal-Mart.  It is a small fishing tackle box, made by <b>Plano</b>.  It holds most of my customizing stuff, helping keep things tidy at home as well.  It is made of semi-flexible plastic, not that brittle stuff, so it can take a little abuse.  Best of all, it was only about $5!</p>

    <td>
      <p>The box is about 7" x 10" x 3".  It has translucent lids on either side to make it easy to find and get what you are looking for.  It has small removable dividers so that you can do some personal configuration of the internal storage spaces.</p>

    <td>
      <p>On one side I keep general supplies such as an Exacto blade, tweezers, superglue, paperclips, sandpaper, paintbrushes, and various spare parts.  There is a small plastic paint mixing tray under the paintbrushes.</p>

  <table cellpadding=10 width="95%" border=0><tr>
    <td>
      <p>On the other side I keep paint, pliers, cutters, scissors, and the base figure.  The kit will easily hold at least one normal-sized 6" scale figure.  It would probably hold two or more 5" or animated scale figures.</p>

      <p>It will hold three or four Apple Barrel size acrylic paint bottles, but it is a tight squeeze.</p>

      <p>I had been looking at tackle boxes for quite some time, but could never find one that met my needs without being huge.  None of the small ones I liked would hold a standard size acrylic paint bottle until I found this Plano one (no, I don't mean "plain ol' one").  Again, I found this one at Wal-Mart, but other places may have them as well.</p>

      <p>Note:  You can see part of one of my nearly complete 6" Marvel customs in the kit in the top photo.  Can you guess who it is?</p>
