<img src="budman1.jpg" height=329 width=221 align=LEFT>Budman was a creation
spawned from idle time and distorted values stemming from a college dorm
environment, circa 1988. He was constructed from a variety of brands of
beer cans, held together with super glue.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
That's me (10 years and 10 pounds ago) thrown in for scale.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<br>
Budman was only a sculpture, but he did have one action feature - complete
and utter self-destruction. The pictures below tell the sordid tale of
Budman's final hour.&nbsp;<br>

<br>
Let us have a brief moment of silence to remember Budman. He may have only
been a pile of cans; but to those who knew him, he was more like a neatly
stacked pile of cans that was glued together.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Please note that all cans were cleaned up and properly recycled, and that
no animals were harmed in the discourse of this event. Budman was simply
intended to be a novelty item, not an endorsement of alchohol.</h4>
